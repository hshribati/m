    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Remember: HTML is used to structure a document, while CSS is used to style and position items within the document. While it's tempting to do so when you are first learning, don't use HTML tags to style the document.</p>
    <p>You can open the root <code>index.html</code> file in this directory with your browser either with the "ctrl/cmd-O" option, or by dragging the file into your browser window. We're going to use Chrome in class, but you can use any browser you want (except Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge).</p>
    <p>Right click on the page to view the source. You'll see several explanatory notes in the HTML comments.</p>
